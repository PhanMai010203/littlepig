- When using context7, makae sure that you keep the range of output in the range 2k to 10k based on what you think is the best.


- Maintain a file named library.md (in docs/.context7/) to store the Library IDs that you search for and before searching make sure that you check the file and use the library ID already available. Otherwise, search for it.
