## 🔍 **Detailed Analysis Results**

### **🚨 Critical Issues (High Impact)**

#### **1. Timer Management Crisis**
**Files Affected:**
- `lib/core/sync/enhanced_incremental_sync_service.dart` - 15min sync timer

```dart
// Multiple uncoordinated timers
_periodicSyncTimer = Timer.periodic(Duration(minutes: 15), (timer) async {
_cleanupTimer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(hours: 24), (_) async {
_timer = Timer.periodic(widget.refreshInterval, (_) => _updateMetrics());
```

@override
void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
  switch (state) {
    case AppLifecycleState.paused:
      _pauseNonCriticalOperations();

  'animationLevel', 'batterySaver', 'appAnimations'
};
```

4. **Optimize Animation Performance Monitor Interval**
```dart
// Change from 250ms to 1000ms
final Duration refreshInterval = const Duration(milliseconds: 1000);
```

5. **Add Proper Stream Disposal**
```dart
// Add to existing blocs
@override
Future<void> close() {
  _budgetUpdatesSubscription?.cancel();
