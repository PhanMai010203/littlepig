- Each phase has clear objectives and deliverables
- Developers can focus on one area at a time
- Reduces cognitive overhead

### 2. **Package Management**
- Phase-specific package requirements clearly identified
- Conflicts with existing packages explicitly called out
- Risk mitigation strategies included

### 3. **Progressive Implementation**
- Each phase builds upon the previous
- Clear success criteria for each phase
- Dependency relationships clearly defined

### 4. **Comprehensive Testing**
- Phase-specific testing strategies
- Integration tests between phases
- Performance benchmarks established

## 📋 Quick Reference for Each Phase

### Phase 2: Budget Schema Extensions
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Key Packages**: `csv`, `share_plus`, `flutter_charset_detector`, `local_auth`  
**Avoid**: `app_settings`, `system_theme`, `flutter_displaymode`  

**Main Deliverables**:
- Database schema v5 migration
- Advanced budget filtering logic
- CSV export/import functionality
- Budget entity extensions

### Phase 3: Real-Time Updates
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Key Packages**: `local_auth`, `rxdart`, `flutter_performance_tools`  

**Main Deliverables**:
- Real-time budget calculation service
